# Master Thesis:
Rhythm-Focused Style Transfer via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Overview
This topic concentrates on modeling and transferring rhythmic patterns between music styles using RNNs, which are well-suited for sequential data like musical rhythms.

## Key Aspects
- Implement LSTM layers for modeling complex rhythmic structures
- Explore autoregressive models for enhanced rhythmic pattern generation
- Investigate global rhythm style transfer without relying on text transcriptions

## Technical Details
- Architecture: Bi-directional LSTM with attention mechanism
- Input Representation: Use MIDI or piano roll representation for rhythmic patterns
- Training Approach: Implement teacher forcing and scheduled sampling for stable training

## Expected Outcomes
- A model capable of transferring rhythmic styles between different genres of music
- Analysis of the effectiveness of different RNN architectures for rhythm modeling
A novel method for global rhythm style transfer without text transcriptions
